    We're using require_once here because we want to:
    1. Only include the file once
    2. Show us a FATAL ERROR if missing or we've linked the file incorrectly

    Other ways to include files are available:
    include(); - include files multiple times, only warning if missing
    require(); - include file multiple times, FATAL ERROR if missing
    include_once(); - include file ONLY once, only warning if missing

    Adding the _once multiple times just means any future _once of the
    same file gets ignored.

    So:
    require_once('assets/inc/header.php');
    require_once('assets/inc/header.php');
    require_once('assets/inc/header.php');

    Only the first one is loaded, and the others are ignored.
